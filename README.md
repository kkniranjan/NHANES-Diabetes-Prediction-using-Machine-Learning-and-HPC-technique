# NHANES-Diabetes-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-and-HPC-technique
This project predicts diabetes using the NHANES dataset through advanced machine learning techniques. It explores the relationships among demographic characteristics, health measures, and eating habits to identify significant trends for diabetes prediction. Key features include comprehensive data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA) with univariate and bivariate analysis, cluster analysis, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The study implements Random Forest models with and without PCA, comparing their performance to identify the most effective approach. High-performance computational methods using PySpark are also employed for distributed data processing and Random Forest classification. Findings indicate that conventional Random Forest models without PCA provide robust predictions with 85.61% accuracy. The project demonstrates the potential of distributed data analysis and machine learning in healthcare, highlighting the need for tuning high-performance computing methods for large datasets. Contributors include Niranjan, Shrinithi, Hardeep, Benjamin, and Kartheek, each specializing in different aspects of the project.
